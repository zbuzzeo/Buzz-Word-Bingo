# Buzz Word Bingo
**About the game**

Before a meeting the players are asked to enter words with point values. A player can enter a total of **5 words at most**. Once a meeting starts if a word that the player previously entered is heard during a meeting that player can mark that word and score the points increasing their score. Each time the player scores a new word the total increases by the point value.

# Welcome to Team Buzz™
Our game has been getting a lot of traction and we need to rebuild the API server with NodeJS
to handle all the connections, we need you to create the server using **ExpressJS**. Our CTO will provide you with
the specs below.

**At this time:**
- you will not build the front-end.
- you will not implement a database.

## The Specs
We like RESTful architechure. We like CRUD. As always, data will be sent to the server as `x-www-form-urlencoded`.

### Buzz word object
This is how your objects should look like after receiving a `POST` to the uri `/buzzword`

```javascript
{
  buzzWord: String,
  score: Number
  heard: false
}
```

You will store these objects in memory for the time being. Meaning that if the **server** crashes and after restarting and listening again, your app will have no buzzword objects, no collection containing buzzword objects, no scores, nada.

**Routes overview table:**

| **METHOD** **ROUTE (uri)** | **BODY** | **RESPONSE** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /` | empty | render HTML `index.html` | serves the `index.html` |
| `GET /buzzwords` | empty | `{ "buzzWords": [...] }` A JSON response containing an array of current buzz words | Retrieves all buzzwords |
| `POST /buzzword` | `{ "buzzWord": String, "points": Number }` | `{ "success": true }` | Creates a new buzzword object. Returns `true` if successful else `false`|
| `PUT /buzzword` | `{ "buzzWord": String, "heard": Bool }` |  `{ "success": true, newScore: Number }` | Updates a buzzword. Returns `true` and the new score if successful otherwise returns just `false` |
| `DELETE /buzzword` | `{ "buzzWord": String }` | `{ "success": true }` | Delete a buzzword. Returns `true` if successful else `false` |
| `POST /reset` | `{ "reset": true }` | `{ "success": true }` | Resets the server. All buzzwords are removed and scores reset to `0` |

## Routes detailed
`GET /`: Serves the static file `index.html` which should be located in your `public/` directory. For now just have a stub HTML file.

`GET /buzzwords`: Returns a JSON response containing single key, `buzzWords` which will be an array containing objects (see [Buzz Word Object Section](https://gist.github.com/sgnl/378bd9b54c566f0f22ef#buzz-word-object) for details)

`POST /buzzword`: Creates a new buzz word object. The body **should** have these keys:
  - `buzzWord` which contains the buzz word as a `String` and
  - `points` property is how many points that word is worth when scored, this value is of data-type `Number`.
  Example:
  if `{ "buzzword": "Agile is amazing", "score": 1000 }` is sent to this route then the server will create a new [buzz word object](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser#bodyparserurlencodedoptions) and add it to a collection.

`PUT /buzzword`:  Updates a buzz word's `heard` property. The body **should** contain these keys:
  - `buzzWord` which is the buzz word to modify.
  - `heard` Changes the value stored.
  Example:
  if `{ "buzzWord": "Social-Mobile", "heard": true }` is sent to this route then the server will find the buzz word "Social-Mobile" and change it's `heard` property to `true`.

`DELETE /buzzword`: Deletes a buzz word from the collection.


## Middleware to use
[Body-Parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) - Use this module to help parse the `data` coming from a request. Focus on the **[urlencodedoptions](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser#bodyparserurlencodedoptions)** section of the README, use the `extended: true` option. Take some time to scan through the documentation. What is `body-parser` module doing for us? Is this module doing something we previously had to do manually?

## Getting Started
1. Create your own directory for this project, name it `express-todo-api`.
1. You'll be using `git` and `npm` so be sure to **initialize** those tools before you use them.
1. Install the packages you need
1. Use **Postman** to test your routes.
1. Remember to commit often!

# Adding Middleware to Buzz Word Bingo
Now that you have the endpoints built let's (you) build some validations for the data coming over.

Your middleware will check if the request's body contains the required **keys** and also make sure that the values at those keys have values and are of the expected Data-type.

**Example:**
`POST /buzzword` => `{ "buzzWord": String, "points": Number }`

A **POST** request to the resource `/buzzword` should have two keys: `buzzWord` and `points`. Also be sure that the value stored at each key is of the right data type. e.g. `buzzWord` key should contain a value of `String` data type. `points` key should contain a value of `Number` data type.

## Routes which will need validations
**Format below:** `[METHOD] [URI]` => `Expected object`

`POST /buzzword` => `{ "buzzWord": String, "points": Number }`

`PUT /buzzword` => `{ "buzzWord": String, "heard": Bool }`

`DELETE /buzzword` => `{ "buzzWord": String }`

`POST /reset` => `{ "reset": true }`
